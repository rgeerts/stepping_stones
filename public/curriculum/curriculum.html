                        Children explore and learn through play. 
        Our play and learning activities are carried out in a relaxed 
        and child-oriented environment designed to:
                        
                    </p>
                    <ul>

                        Each week a different theme is emphasized 
                        (including: dinosaurs, family, shapes and pirates) 
                        and many of the classroom activities are organized around this theme.
                    </p>
                    <p>
The daily schedule includes free choice, craft/learning project,
calendar, story time, large and small group activities. 
Children participate in music, movement, journal writing, creative dramatics, yoga 
and science. Activities promote language, multi-sensory and gross motors development. 
During snack time, the T/TH children help serve a variety of nutritious snacks. 
The children in the MWF class break into groups for Spanish and Sign Language lessons 
before eating lunch at school. The day ends with active play time, which takes place 
either outside or in the indoor gym depending on weather conditions.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The world becomes our classroom as the children embark
                        on regular educational field trips to local sites. In the 
                        past these have included trips to Dane's Dairy, Safety Village, 
                        Wilson's Apple Orchard, Hickory Hill Park, the Bus Barn, Hy-Vee, 
                        and the Fire Station. Some of our special days include Beach Day, 
                        Comfy Day, Mother's Day, Pet Day, and our Halloween Parade.
                    </p>

Parents are encouraged to share their professional expertise and hobbies 
with us in the classroom. In the past these have included nurses, paramedics, 
librarians, highway patrol officers, dental hygienist and farmers. Parents 
have also taught some German, French, Japanese and Taekwondo.
